/*
// Notes

- It's the value, not the variable, that determines the data type.
- When you declare a variable but do not set a value, the variable is undefined, and the value is undefined. Ex:
let year;
year is an undefined variable type, and it's value is undefined.
- There is a legacy bug in the browser that defines typeof null as an object, but this is not correct.

// Assignments

let country = "Canada";
let continent = "North America";
let population = 37500000;

console.log(country);
console.log(continent);
console.log(population);

let x = true;

console.log(typeof x);
